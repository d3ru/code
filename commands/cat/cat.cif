==name cat

==short-description

Concatenate the specified files and write their contents to C<stdout>.

==see-also

L<match|match>, L<tail|tail>

==argument filename file_name optional multiple

The names of the files to be concatenated. May contain wild characters C<*> and C<?>. If none specified, reads from C<stdin>.

==option bool f force

Read the files even if they are open exclusively by another process. Runs a small risk of the data read being corrupt.

==option bool b binary

Similar to C<--encoding binary>, but in addition sets the console mode to binary (so, for eg, line endings are not translated)

==option enum e encoding

Encoding to use. If not specified, defaults to 'auto'.

==enum-value auto

Use charconv to try and figure out the encoding (slow and error-prone for anything other than UTF-16 with BOM).

==enum-value binary

Read the files in binary mode and do not perform any character conversion.

==enum-value utf-8

Assume the file is UTF-8 (with or without BOM).

==enum-value latin1

Assume the file is encoded using ISO-8859-1.

==enum-value ltk-utf-8

Assume the file is UTF-8, but use the RLtkBuf16 UTF-8 parser rather than the charconv one (useful for testing).

==option int s block-size

Specify the block size to use for reading the file(s), in bytes. If not specified, defaults to 512 bytes.
