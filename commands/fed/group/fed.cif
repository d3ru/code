==long-description

Fed is a basic console text editor. Its interface is similar to pico/nano. It can handle ASCII, UTF-8 and UTF-16 format files, different line endings, very large files, copy and paste, and opening multiple files at once.

The supported commands are given below. The control key is represented as a caret '^', so ^G means Control-G.

=head1 Clipboard support

The standard Symbian clipboard is supported. You can use ^V to paste into the frontmost document. Cut and copy are two-stage operations, because of the limitations of the console:

To begin a cut/copy operation, press ^X or ^C. Then move the cursor to the other end of the selection you want to make, and press ^X/^C again to confirm the cut/copy operation.
