/*
 Class responsible for arranging windows on the screen. For now it handles only one main window and one command window.
 New windows can be added by calling AddViewL. The class should rearrange visible windows and resize appropriate views.
 Many views can be shown in the same window - switching between visible views is done by calling AttachViewL. The class
 automatically disables old views and activates new views. If more than one window is supported then there may be
 another function necessary which attaches a provided view to a particular window, not just the default one.
