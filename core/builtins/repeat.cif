==name repeat

==short-description

Execute a command-line multiple times.

==long-description

On each iteration, the environment variable C<REPEAT_COUNT> is set to an integer value representing the iteration number currently being processed. This can be used, for example, to produce unique file names.

Note that unlike L<source|source>, L<foreach|foreach> and L<while|while>, changes to environment variables within C<command> do I<not> update the parent environment. This is mostly for legacy reasons.

For a more expressive looping primitive, see the L<while|while> command.

==argument uint count

The number of repetitions to perform. If set to zero, will repeat indefinitely.

==argument string command last

The command to run.

==option bool k keep-going

If an iteration returns an error, proceed with the next iteration. Ordinarily execution will abort if an error is returned.

==option int w wait

If specified, wait this number of milliseconds between iterations.
