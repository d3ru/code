==name rm

==short-description

Remove one or more files.

==argument filename file_name multiple

The name of the file to be removed. May contain wild characters C<*> and C<?> to specify more than one file.

==option bool r recurse

Also delete files in sub-directories.

==option bool f force

Force delete the file even if it is read-only (won't allow you to delete a directory containing read-only files).

==option string n noexpand multiple

This option takes a filename similar to the C<filename> argument. The difference is that it doesn't attempt to expand wildcards and instead passes them straight through to CFileMan. This can be useful when a directory has a huge number of files and C<rm *> fails with KErrNoMemory. In this case, try doing C<rm --noexpand *> instead.
