==name var

==short-description

Perform an operation involving environment variables.

==long-description

This command returns zero (KErrNone) in the success case, and a non-zero positive code otherwise. Usage:

    var SOMETHING defined # Doesn't cause an error, returns '1'
    var SOMETHING defined && echo Defined # Nothing is echoed
    export SOMETHING 1
    var SOMETHING defined && echo Defined # "Defined" will be printed
    var SOMETHING == 1 && echo "Equal" # "Equal" will be printed
    var SOMETHING add 3 && echo "$SOMETHING" # $SOMETHING now has value "4"

C<==> and C<!=> are text comparisons not numerical, and all environment variables are strings, so the following will I<not> work:

    export VAL 16
    var VAL == 0x10 && echo Equal # Error! "16" does not equal "0x10"

==argument string variable

The environment variable to be operated on.

==argument enum operation

==enum-value ==

Tests if the specified environment variable is an exact string match for the supplied argument.

==enum-value !=

Opposite of C<==>.

==enum-value add

Assume that the specified environment variable holds an integer, and adds the value given by the argument to it. If the variable isn't defined or doesn't contain a decimal integer, it is assumed to have value zero.

==enum-value subtract

Subtracts the given value from the environment variable. Semantics as per add.
