==name grep

==short-description

Unix-style grep with full Regular Expression support.

==argument string pattern

The pattern to be matched. To escape Regex special characters use '\'.

==option bool i ignore-case

Ignore case distinctions.

==option bool v invert-match

Print lines that do B<not> match.

==option bool c count

Don't print the lines that match, just count them and print the total at the end. If used with C<--invert-match>, counts the number of non-matching lines.

==option bool u unicode

Run the search in unicode (UTF-8) mode rather than assuming ASCII. Possibly slower.

==long-description

Prints to C<stdout> any lines of C<stdin> that match a particular pattern. Uses the PCRE library.
